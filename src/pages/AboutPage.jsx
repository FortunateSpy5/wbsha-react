            <p>Handball in India is governed by the Handball Association India (HAI), which was founded in 1972 by
              Jagat Singh Lohan, a graduate of the YMCA College of Physical Education in Madras. Lohan's efforts
              during the Munich Olympics helped to establish the HAI. The founding member states were Andhra
              Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Vidharbha, and Jammu and Kashmir. Lohan was also elected the first
              secretary general of the HAI. The first Senior Men's National Handball Championship was held in 1972
              at Sir Chhotu Ram Stadium in Rohtak.</p>
            <p>In 1973, handball was introduced to Bengal by Nirmal Mukerjee, Bijay Krishna Bose, and Suranjan
              Dutta, who were prominent sports personalities at the time. The West Bengal State Handball
              Association was established and registered under the Registrar Society Act, Government of West
              Bengal 1961, and received affiliation to the HAI in the same year. It continues to operate
              successfully and proudly from its registered office at 1, Nelly Sengupta Sarani (formerly Lindsay
              Street), 2nd Floor, New Market, Kolkata 700087.</p>
            <p>At present, handball has rapidly spread throughout Bengal, with numerous districts actively
              participating in and promoting the sport. The performance of the Bengal team, as well as individual
              players, has been quite remarkable since the game's inception in the state in 1973.</p>
